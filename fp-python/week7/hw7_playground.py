	 * Adopted from the poem by Ogden Nash:
	 * The Cat
	 *
	 * (Ogden Nash)
	 *
	 * You get a wife, you get a house,
	 * Eventually you get a mouse.
	 * You get some words regarding mice,
	 * You get a kitty in a trice.
	 *
	 * By two a.m. or thereabouts,
	 * The mouse is in, the cat is out.
	 * It dawns upon you, in your cot,
	 * The mouse is silent, the cat is not.
	 *
	 * Instead of kitty, says your spouse,
	 * You should have got another mouse.
